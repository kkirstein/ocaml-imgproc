# ocaml-playground

A image processing library written in OCaml.

## Motivation

Why another image library, as there are many good libraries available, for which OCaml bindings could be made, e.g., [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) or [VIPS](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=VIPS)?

* Programming in OCaml is fun!
* There are always features I am missing in existing libraries or prefer to behave differently.
* I would like to show that image processing can be done in a functional programming language with decent performance (If you take a closer look at the source, you will see that I'm cheating, there is plenty of imperative code like for loops).
* I certainly suffer from the NIH (not invented here) syndrome...

## Status

Pretty much pre-alpha...
